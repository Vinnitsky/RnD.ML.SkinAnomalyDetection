True target\r\nlesions are tripartite and consist of sharply marginated circular\r\nor polycyclic lesions with central dusky erythema, concentric\r\nedematous blanching, rimmed by a macular erythematous border.\r\nAtypical lesions may be flatter and consist of two instead of three\r\nzones. The central portion may be bullous in both true target\r\nlesions and atypical lesions. Mucosal lesions are seen in 25% of\r\ncases and typically affect the oral mucosa. EM may be seen in\r\nassociation with herpes simplex infection, mycoplasma pneumonial\r\ninfection, contact dermatitis, medications, radiation or be\r\nidiopathic. Rare associations with EM include orf, vaccinia,\r\nvaricella zoster, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),\r\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis, coxsackievirus, parvovirus, HIV,\r\nchlamydia, salmonella, tuberculosis, leprosy, histoplasma and\r\ndermatophyte infections (Hughey SL, 2010). Atypical forms with\r\nurticarial plaques or oral lesions alone, however, can present\r\ndiagnostic dilemmas. Urticarial lesions with target-like central\r\nduskiness are often misdiagnosed as EM; this likely represents a\r\nclinical syndrome of 'urticaria multiforme' seen in children that\r\nhas distinct clinical and histologic features (Shah KN et al,\r\n2007). The classification and terminology of EM in the literature\r\nis controversial, and at times, confusing. EM may be clinically\r\nsubdivided into EM minor and EM major, connoting distinct disease\r\nassociations. EM minor is typified by minimal skin and/or mucosal\r\ndisease, with minimal systemic symptoms, in association with either\r\nHSV or mycoplasma pneumonial infection. Therapy is generally not\r\nrequired or helpful for EM minor (limited to skin and/or one\r\nmucosal surface without systemic symptoms). Because this form of EM\r\ninvariably follows infection and is self-limited, usually lasting\r\nonly days to weeks, in the majority of cases the therapeutic\r\nstrategy is symptom control or no treatment at all. However, if the\r\nproblem is recurrent, the therapeutic strategy is to prevent and/or\r\ntreat the causative herpes virus infection to prevent additional\r\nepisodes. EM major (sometimes alternatively termed infection or\r\ndrug-related SJS), however, requires inpatient management because\r\nof significant systemic symptoms and involvement of one and usually\r\nmore mucosal surfaces. Unfortunately, specific therapy does not\r\nexist, and administration of systemic steroids may cause\r\ncomplications. Fortunately, like EM minor, the disease is\r\nself-limited regardless of severity, and supportive care is the\r\nmainstay of treatment.</p>\r\n", "furtherReading" : "\r\n<p>Hughey SL.
